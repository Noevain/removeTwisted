# RemoveTwisted

Version 2.0.0 update:Changed how the mod works, now directly hooks into the director on spawn function and if the director tried to spawn a twisted, it will replace it with a malachite.

We are finally free from the twisted plague brothers.

This mod is fully server side,only the host need to have it, if you STILL  find twisted in your game ping @noevain in the RoR2 modding discord.

~~Remove the twisted elite type by making their cost to the director extremely high so that it doesnt spawn them, BEWARE: this will change how the director behaves and might causes less spawn on long runs, this solution is far from elegant so if anyone who's actually familiar with R2API can comes with a better one it'll probably be better but at least this works for now.~~
